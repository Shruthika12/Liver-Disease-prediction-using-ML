# Liver-Disease-prediction-using-ML
The Liver Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning project is designed to predict liver disease with high accuracy by leveraging machine learning techniques. The dataset for this project was obtained from the Indian Liver Patient Dataset available on Kaggle, which contains medical records of patients. The project involves various steps, including data preprocessing, feature selection, model training, and evaluation using different machine learning algorithms. The key algorithms used include Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors, Gradient Boosting, and Extreme Gradient Boosting. The system aims to provide a more accurate and efficient method for detecting liver disease compared to traditional diagnostic methods.

The existing system for diagnosing liver disease typically involves medical tests such as blood tests, biopsy, and imaging techniques like ultrasound, MRI, or CT scans. These traditional methods are time-consuming, costly, and require expert interpretation. Moreover, invasive procedures like liver biopsy can be uncomfortable and risky for patients. The proposed system addresses these limitations by implementing machine learning models that analyze patient data and predict liver disease based on key medical indicators such as Total Bilirubin, Direct Bilirubin, and other relevant factors. By using machine learning, the system automates the prediction process, improving diagnostic accuracy and reducing dependency on medical professionals.

The technical implementation of this project involves the use of Python, with libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, and Keras for model development. The front-end is developed using Python and integrated with Django for backend processing. The system utilizes MySQL for database management. The machine learning models are trained and tested using a split dataset to ensure robustness and accuracy. Various performance metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrices, are used to evaluate the effectiveness of different algorithms.

The feasibility study conducted for this project confirms its economic, technical, and social viability. Since the project is developed as part of an academic research initiative, there are minimal costs involved. Technically, the system is feasible as it requires only basic computational resources and can be implemented without extensive modifications to existing infrastructures. Socially, the project is beneficial as it aids in early diagnosis and treatment planning, ultimately improving patient outcomes.

Future enhancements of this project could include real-time analysis, incorporation of additional biomarkers and imaging data, and integration with healthcare systems for broader clinical applications. The system could also be extended to predict other liver-related conditions and diseases, further enhancing its medical utility. By leveraging advancements in machine learning and medical data analysis, this project has the potential to transform liver disease diagnosis and contribute significantly to the healthcare sector.
